                Canyoning on the river Cetina is one of the best adventures you can try in Croatia. Enjoy in the hidden natural beauty of
                Cetina's canyon, miraculous rocky landscapes of the canyon that has dept up to 150 m. Regular canyoning includes
                walking and swimming through the rapids, swimming in crystal clear natural pools, cliff-jumping in the lakes
                and waterfalls of river Cetina. All you need for regular canyoning is a swimsuit , sports shoes and of course
                an adventurous spirit (you do not need any previous experince).
