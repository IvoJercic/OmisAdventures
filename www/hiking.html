                                    <h6>FORTRESS FORTICA</h6>(STARI GRAD) The hike to the fortress Fortica starts from Planovo
                                    ,which is a part of Omiš on the northwest side of the mountain, at 9 am and lasts about
                                    2.30-3 hours (the total hiking distance is 2340 meters). Fortress Fortica is located
                                    at the mountain range called Omiška Dinara. The highest peak of the massif is at 850
                                    meters above the sea level and it is called The Tower, while the fortress Fortica is
                                    located at 303 meters above the sea level. Expect a breathtaking view of the Dalmatian
                                    islands and an interesting historical story about the fortress Fortica.The fortress Fortica
                                    is located at the top of Dinara Mountain. The first part of the fortress Fortica was
                                    built at the begining of the 14th century ,and it was completed in the mid-15th century.
                                    Fortress Fortica was built primarily for defending the city from the enemy. It was very
                                    important for piracy – it is a site of strategic importance with a broad view on all
                                    movements across the middle Poljica as well as over the navigation in the sea channel
                                    between Split and Makarska. From the fortress we have a beautiful view of the entire
                                    city, the canyon of the river Cetina, Brač Channel, islands of Brač, Hvar, Šolta and
                                    most of Poljica. In the event that Omiš was besieged, from the fortress there would have
                                    been thrown large boulders that would have destroyed the entire city and therefore the
                                    enemy . Today, we are proud and happy that this did not happen and that we can enjoy
                                    the delights of this beautiful Dalmatian town.
