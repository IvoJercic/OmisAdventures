                If you are looking for a relaxing trip, full of fun and excitement, kayaking is the perfect choice for you. Our kayaking
                tour starts 5 miles upstream from the city of Omiš where your kayaks and your guide will be waiting for you.
                After just a short briefing on kayaking and the river Cetina, your journey begins! As you slowly continue
                down the river you will find that it is full of mystery and won't be able to resist taking a dip in its refreshing
                water. Soon enough, you will reach the city of Omiš where the river connects to the sea. But your journey
                doesn't end there! Our rough history has resulted in a ship being sunk in just 3 meters of sea depth making
                it perfect for us to explore it. Whats more, our finish is a mile long sandy beach which is just perfect
                for all beach activities. Lastly, leave your cameras at home! Your guide is equipped with a Hi-tech camera
                and all his footage will be provided to you free.
