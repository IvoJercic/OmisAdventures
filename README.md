This is the final project for a subject at a college called mobile application programming. I worked on the project together with another colleague.

The project was made using web technologies html, css, javascript. 
Then we used PhoneGap and Cordova to build it as mobile application.

Here is the www folder of the project, but if you want to run it on your mobile device you need to download

-->	PhoneGap
https://phonegap.com/getstarted/

Create new blank phonegap project and put this files inside of it.

You will then need to download the phonegap to your mobile device. 
Then on your computer within the phonegap application run the folder with the www folder in it,
and when the server is started, 
connect to that server with the phonegap mobile application and there you go.
